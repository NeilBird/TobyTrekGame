## Introduction

Emily Bird, first experience of "Vibe Coding", using an AI Agent, and prompts to code a game. Our cat "Toby" sadly passed away today, we will miss him dearly, to commemorate his passing and memory, we decided to create a game called "Toby Trek", let's see how good AI is at helping people code and do their jobs.

### Prompts

## 1

I would like to create a web based game, that can be accessed using a browser. The idea for the game is that the user is a cat called "Toby", the user moves the cat left and right at the bottom of the screen, the "world" or game level will be falling towards the user, who is the cat. The user will use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cat on the screen, the cat "Toby" needs to collect "Toby Treats" to maintain his energy, which reduces over time, if he does not eat the falling "Toby Treats". In addition to treats, there will also be "bad things" that fall down the scree, that the cat must avoid, such as a Hairdryer and a vacuum cleaner, these "bad" objects could look similar in colour to the treats, so that user might collect them by mistake. The "falling scenery" of the game could also include bushes and puddles, that the cat must avoid, as cats do not like water. As the level progresses, and get passed half way, the game will "speed up", which means the scenery (that is constantly moving towards the player of the game who controls "Toby" the cat), would start to speed up, which would make it harder to react to the objects.

## 2

Please make Toby white, with black and grey colours. Please add some music as a background, can you add a timer counting up, so that you know how long you have been playing. Instead of the objects falling down, can we alter the aspect ratio so that they are coming towards you, more like running down a tunnel, than objects falling from the sky?

## 3

This is better, however, please can there only two "bad" things and two "good" things, the bad things can be a puddle of water and a hair dryer. The good items can be the Chicken leg and the Shrimp. Can the tunnel have a background, so that it looks like garden, with green grass near Toby and blue sky with clouds and sun. Also can it be a little slower, as when it speeds up, it is too fast.

## 4

Please create a new "CHANGELOG" file in the working folder, and a version number of the game, so that we can track improvements and changes over time. Please add the most recent changes as version 0.1.0.

## 5

On the "home screen", toby is the wrong colour, please update him.

## 6

The colour looks better, but the icon is not shown in the box correctly

## 7

The start button is not shown now!! - Please correct the home screen properly!

## 8

On the game over screen, Toby is the wrong colour, please update for consistency. Instead of the game continuing for ever, can we add levels that complete, and the next level looks a little different, such as different backgrounds, like a park with slides and swings, or even perhaps Toby goes into outer space, and there are stars and planets. Also the icon for the hair dryer looks like a cloud of gas, such as a fart, please update the Hair dryer to look like an actual hair dryer. Also do you think we could occasionally have a "Shield" that gives you temporary protection from the puddles and hair dryer, which is you collect the shield, the game shows a count down, and Toby is protected by a bubble, when the shield expires, the bubble pops. And the flowers on level 1, looks too basic, give them more detail. And lastly, can we improve the music please?

## 9

Change the music, make it less childish and annoying. Change the  hair dryer object that you need to avoid, to be a Fish Skeleton. And change the Shrimp to a "Nice" Fish, that is a similar shape to the dead fish. Make each different theme, only have two levels instead of three, garden level 1, park level 2 and outer space level 3. We could also add a "Snow" themed level after space. Please also update Toby's eyes, to be yellow / green colour, with black pupils. Overall can you make it more realistic, like a video game?

## 10

Please update the README.md to reflect the code in this repository.

## 11

Revert the "bad" fish skeleton, so that it is a Hair Dryer again, make the "good" fish a can of Tuna. Can swap levels around, leave levels 1 and 2 as the garden theme, then the park theme to levels 3 and 4, then follow this with the Snow themed levels (as 5 and 6), and move the Outer Space levels to the last levels, (as 7 and 8).

## 12

When Toby eats something good, make him smile and say "Yum yum", and when he runs into the water or hair dryer, make his face very sad and make him cry a little.

## 13

At the start of each new level, Toby Energy should reset to full. Can we add a Top Score Leader board on the home page, and ask each user to enter their name, before playing, if they do not enter a name, default to "Player 1". Also, I would you to completely upgrade the game play, so that Toby is running forwards, and the scenery at the sides of each level also moves down, instead of the objects simply falling towards Toby, this will make it more realistic and less childish. For example, on the snow level, we could add occasional Snowmen and Grit bins at the side, that Toby cannot reach or touch, but they move down the sides as well. Can you make Toby make a noise in addition to the facial expressions, such as "Yey" for good things that he eats, and "Eeew" for bad things, to improve the game interaction with the sounds.

## 14

Please update the home page, as the leader board does not fit inside the box correctly. The Toby icon is not visible at the top.

## 15

Great updates thank you. Instead of "Eeew", when hitting a puddle or hair dryer, it should more like "Oww", like it hurts Toby. Another improvement, please can the Flowers on the garden level, that are currently static down the sides become part of scenery and move. Similar on the other levels, the original items that are down the side of the path, like flowers or Christmas trees, those need to move to make it look and feel more dynamic. Are there any other changes you can suggest to make the game look and play better? Does the html work on mobile devices, which I need?

## 16

AI Suggested Improvements:
Here are additional enhancements you could consider:

Particle Effects: Add sparkles when collecting treats, splash when hitting puddles
Screen Shake: Brief shake when Toby hits a hazard for more impact
Combo System: Bonus points for collecting multiple treats in a row
Power-ups: Speed boost, magnet (attracts treats), double points
Sound Toggle: Add mute button for music/SFX
Difficulty Settings: Easy/Normal/Hard modes
Achievements: Unlock badges for milestones (100 treats, complete all levels, etc.)
Daily Challenge: Different obstacle patterns each day
Character Skins: Unlock different Toby outfits
Pause Feature: Ability to pause the game mid-level
Would you like me to implement any of these additional features?

All of these please.

And in addition to the nice License summary in the README, 'Created with ❤️ in memory of Toby (2026)' (keep this nice wording) can you please also add that this repo uses the MIT license.
