## Introduction

Emily Bird, first experience of "Vibe Coding", using an AI Agent, and prompts to code a game. Our cat "Toby" sadly passed away today, we will miss him dearly, to commemorate his passing and memory, we decided to create a game called "Toby Trek", let's see how good AI is at helping people code and do their jobs.

### Prompts

## 1

I would like to create a web based game, that can be accessed using a browser. The idea for the game is that the user is a cat called "Toby", the user moves the cat left and right at the bottom of the screen, the "world" or game level will be falling towards the user, who is the cat. The user will use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cat on the screen, the cat "Toby" needs to collect "Toby Treats" to maintain his energy, which reduces over time, if he does not eat the falling "Toby Treats". In addition to treats, there will also be "bad things" that fall down the scree, that the cat must avoid, such as a Hairdryer and a vacuum cleaner, these "bad" objects could look similar in colour to the treats, so that user might collect them by mistake. The "falling scenery" of the game could also include bushes and puddles, that the cat must avoid, as cats do not like water. As the level progresses, and get passed half way, the game will "speed up", which means the scenery (that is constantly moving towards the player of the game who controls "Toby" the cat), would start to speed up, which would make it harder to react to the objects.

## 2

Please make Toby white, with black and grey colours. Please add some music as a background, can you add a timer counting up, so that you know how long you have been playing. Instead of the objects falling down, can we alter the aspect ratio so that they are coming towards you, more like running down a tunnel, than objects falling from the sky?

## 3

This is better, however, please can there only two "bad" things and two "good" things, the bad things can be a puddle of water and a hair dryer. The good items can be the Chicken leg and the Shrimp. Can the tunnel have a background, so that it looks like garden, with green grass near Toby and blue sky with clouds and sun. Also can it be a little slower, as when it speeds up, it is too fast.

## 4

Please create a new "CHANGELOG" file in the working folder, and a version number of the game, so that we can track improvements and changes over time. Please add the most recent changes as version 0.1.0.

## 5

On the "home screen", toby is the wrong colour, please update him.

## 6

The colour looks better, but the icon is not shown in the box correctly

## 7

The start button is not shown now!! - Please correct the home screen properly!

## 8

On the game over screen, Toby is the wrong colour, please update for consistency. Instead of the game continuing for ever, can we add levels that complete, and the next level looks a little different, such as different backgrounds, like a park with slides and swings, or even perhaps Toby goes into outer space, and there are stars and planets. Also the icon for the hair dryer looks like a cloud of gas, such as a fart, please update the Hair dryer to look like an actual hair dryer. Also do you think we could occasionally have a "Shield" that gives you temporary protection from the puddles and hair dryer, which is you collect the shield, the game shows a count down, and Toby is protected by a bubble, when the shield expires, the bubble pops. And the flowers on level 1, looks too basic, give them more detail. And lastly, can we improve the music please?

## 9

Change the music, make it less childish and annoying. Change the  hair dryer object that you need to avoid, to be a Fish Skeleton. And change the Shrimp to a "Nice" Fish, that is a similar shape to the dead fish. Make each different theme, only have two levels instead of three, garden level 1, park level 2 and outer space level 3. We could also add a "Snow" themed level after space. Please also update Toby's eyes, to be yellow / green colour, with black pupils. Overall can you make it more realistic, like a video game?

## 10

Please update the README.md to reflect the code in this repository.

## 11

Revert the "bad" fish skeleton, so that it is a Hair Dryer again, make the "good" fish a can of Tuna. Can swap levels around, leave levels 1 and 2 as the garden theme, then the park theme to levels 3 and 4, then follow this with the Snow themed levels (as 5 and 6), and move the Outer Space levels to the last levels, (as 7 and 8).

## 12

When Toby eats something good, make him smile and say "Yum yum", and when he runs into the water or hair dryer, make his face very sad and make him cry a little.

## 13

At the start of each new level, Toby Energy should reset to full. Can we add a Top Score Leader board on the home page, and ask each user to enter their name, before playing, if they do not enter a name, default to "Player 1". Also, I would you to completely upgrade the game play, so that Toby is running forwards, and the scenery at the sides of each level also moves down, instead of the objects simply falling towards Toby, this will make it more realistic and less childish. For example, on the snow level, we could add occasional Snowmen and Grit bins at the side, that Toby cannot reach or touch, but they move down the sides as well. Can you make Toby make a noise in addition to the facial expressions, such as "Yey" for good things that he eats, and "Eeew" for bad things, to improve the game interaction with the sounds.

## 14

Please update the home page, as the leader board does not fit inside the box correctly. The Toby icon is not visible at the top.

## 15

Great updates thank you. Instead of "Eeew", when hitting a puddle or hair dryer, it should more like "Oww", like it hurts Toby. Another improvement, please can the Flowers on the garden level, that are currently static down the sides become part of scenery and move. Similar on the other levels, the original items that are down the side of the path, like flowers or Christmas trees, those need to move to make it look and feel more dynamic. Are there any other changes you can suggest to make the game look and play better? Does the html work on mobile devices, which I need?

## 16

AI Suggested Improvements:
Here are additional enhancements you could consider:

Particle Effects: Add sparkles when collecting treats, splash when hitting puddles
Screen Shake: Brief shake when Toby hits a hazard for more impact
Combo System: Bonus points for collecting multiple treats in a row
Power-ups: Speed boost, magnet (attracts treats), double points
Sound Toggle: Add mute button for music/SFX
Difficulty Settings: Easy/Normal/Hard modes
Achievements: Unlock badges for milestones (100 treats, complete all levels, etc.)
Daily Challenge: Different obstacle patterns each day
Character Skins: Unlock different Toby outfits
Pause Feature: Ability to pause the game mid-level
Would you like me to implement any of these additional features?

All of these please.

And in addition to the nice License summary in the README, 'Created with ❤️ in memory of Toby (2026)' (keep this nice wording) can you please also add that this repo uses the MIT license.

## 17

is there an end boss on level 13?

## 18

can i add 1 more world ... do you have any ideas?

## 19

so,i want an end boss every 10 levels ,i want it to be a angry black cat and its in a castle .you collect something maybe a muscle or punch and when you get to the end you throw them and try and defeat the cat.

## 20

do you need to update the README.md? - We are publishing the web page using GitHub Pages, would it be possible to store the Leader board high score so that all users can see other users scores? and not just their own scores?

## 21

About the Shared Leaderboard
Would you like me to implement Firebase for a global leaderboard? Here's what you'd need to do:

Create a free Firebase project at firebase.google.com
Enable Realtime Database (free tier: 1GB storage, 10GB/month transfer)
Copy your Firebase config to the game
If you want to proceed, let me know and I'll:

Add the Firebase SDK
Create functions to save/load scores globally
Update the leaderboard display to show all players' scores
Add real-time updates so you see new scores appear!
The free tier is more than enough for a game like this. Would you like me to implement it? 🏆

yes, I will create a Firebase project now.

## 22

Using the instructions provided by Claude, we setup a Google Firebase Realtime database using this endpoint: https://console.firebase.google.com/
And secured the database with simple Rules, to prevent garbage being written into the database.

## 23

Can we update the Home screen of the web page to make it simpler and more modern, as it is very cluttered and looks old school. Could we have a button for "Game rules" or instructions, so that they are not always shown?

## 24

How does the Coins / Points / Currency work to get new skins? Is there a shop interface? Can we call the currency for the skins and mods, "Kitty Coins" please?

## 25

The space is too fast and difficult, even on easy mode, can this be improved. Also the music is still not great, can this be improved please? When playing on mobile, Toby's Energy bar is not visible in Safari on iOS. Can we move the energy bar on mobile experience, to be above the right / left control buttons? On mobile, how are punches thrown if this uses a space bar on a device that uses a keyboard? - Also can we move the Boss's to be every 6 levels, instead of 10 levels please?

## 26

Would it be possible to make Toby more animated, so that the game play makes it look like he is actually running forward, towards the track? rather than just sitting still?

## 27

In the Boss Battle, the "BOSS BATTLE! Press SPACE or tap 👊 to throw!" prompt is shown, but there appears to be no way to remove that message and fight the boss? Is this a bug in the UI? As I am unable to fight Dave the Boss? - For the second Boss, can you make this the "Big Bad Hoover" please, then the third boss can be the "Creepy Crazy Cucumber" please, then the final "big boss" can be the cute puppy "Dangerous Dougie the Dog" ?

## 28

on level  6 toby is unable to move to fight the boss this is still a bug?

## 29

Toby can still not move on the Boss Level, can I share Debug output from the Developer Tools of the web broswer on a laptop?

## 30

## 31

Users report that they do not have enough Fists to defeat the Bosses on the Boss Levels. During the Boss Levels, when the Hair Dryers are coming to harm Toby, should we also have a small number of Fists to collect, otherwise it is very difficult to defeat the Bosses?

## 32

I don't think the Leaderboard is working, there is still no data in the Realtime database?

## 33

Can you check that the "Skins" are working in the shop? - A user told me they bought a skin, and it showed "Equipped" but when they started a new game Toby looked the same?

## 34

Can we make the player name mandatory, and remove the default "Player 1" text?

## 35

can we make the background music more "classic arcade" style please?

## 36

On the "How to play" screen, it states the "BOSS every 10 levels", I think this is incorrect? - Are the boss levels every 6 levels now? - Also is this the correct order for the levels "Garden --> Snow --> Park --> Space --> " in the "How to Play" screen? - Also, where it shows your "Coins" on the home page, can we add the text "Kitty Coins" to the left of the icon? - Do you have any ideas for how we can improve the shop? - And the icon for the Shop, looks like a paint pallet, which is not great?, should this look like a shop or supermarket icon? - Also on the "Top Scores" global leaderboard, in addition to the total points the player scored, can we add the level they reached? Which could just show blank for existing scores, but track for all new scores? Also, for the three "Difficulty" modes of the game, can these offer a Points multiplier, so that if you play the game on "Easy" you get less points, and if you play on Hard, you get more points throughout the game levels, and show this pointers multiple on the "How to Play" screen. And lastly, a user reported that when a BOSS is defeated, that it is still possible to sustain damage from hair dryers for a few seconds after beating / completing the boss, can we fix this please? - Please make these changes with a new version of 1.0.0.

## 37

Note about Shop improvements: The shop currently shows skins with purchase options. Some ideas to improve it further could include:

Category tabs (Skins, Accessories, Power-ups)
Preview animations
"New" badges on recent items
Sorting options (by price, popularity)

Would you like me to implement any shop improvements, or should I commit these changes and create a PR for v1.0.0?

Answer:
Thanks, implement all those shop improvements as part of v1.0.0 and update the changelog and readme.md

## 38

A user has reported that when you play the game using Safari on an Apple iOS device, playing the game in portrait mode, the left and right buttons work, but when you press them, they sometimes highlight in blue, like the Safari browser has selected the icon to allow you to copy and paste the hightlighted object, this is not required and gives the impression that the button is not working correctly on mobile devices? - Can we improve the movement (left and right) icons in anyway to prevent this selection?

## 39

can you make the puddle look more like a puddle and not a water drop?

## 40

Users report that when playing the game on mobile, in portrait mode, the screen layout is not ideal and is difficult to use, can we move the navigation buttons and energy button up the screen, so they are directly below the game play with less gap? - To prevent players closing the web browser tab by mistake when playing the game?

## 41

The changes to the navigation buttons and energy bar, have resulted in the energy bar blocking the view of Toby. Can we pin the Energy bar below the bar that shows the time, score and level? The mobile experience is not great. I am testing using Safari on an Apple iOS device (iPhone 16 Pro).

## 42

A user reported that they purchased a Top Hat in the store, and it showed "Equipped" but Toby was not wearing it, do all of the items that can be purchased in the shop work?

## 43

On the BOSS levels, the Boss's energy is not visible, only Toby's energy can be seen, can we put them side by side on the BOSS levels? - Also, on the boss levels, can we only offer additional Punches, when the user has run out, and then send two or three only, as it seems a little easy to immediately send additional punches at the start of a boss level, when the user already has the punches they have collected. Another idea that has been suggested, during normal levels, could we add the ability for Toby to jump over puddles, perhaps using the space bar, or adding a "Jump" button for mobile browsers?

## 44

During game play, please can you add "Sponsors: Caterpillar Catering Ltd and Beat-Herder Festival" in small text, centered below the game play, use the hyper link "https://www.caterpillarcatering.co.uk" for the Caterpillar Catering company name and "https://beatherder.co.uk"
