## Introduction

Emily Bird, first experience of "Vibe Coding", using an AI Agent, and prompts to code a game. Our cat "Toby" sadly passed away today, we will miss him dearly, to commemorate his passing and memory, we decided to create a game called "Toby Trek", let's see how good AI is at helping people code and do their jobs.

### Prompts

## 1

I would like to create a web based game, that can be accessed using a browser. The idea for the game is that the user is a cat called "Toby", the user moves the cat left and right at the bottom of the screen, the "world" or game level will be falling towards the user, who is the cat. The user will use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cat on the screen, the cat "Toby" needs to collect "Toby Treats" to maintain his energy, which reduces over time, if he does not eat the falling "Toby Treats". In addition to treats, there will also be "bad things" that fall down the scree, that the cat must avoid, such as a Hairdryer and a vacuum cleaner, these "bad" objects could look similar in colour to the treats, so that user might collect them by mistake. The "falling scenery" of the game could also include bushes and puddles, that the cat must avoid, as cats do not like water. As the level progresses, and get passed half way, the game will "speed up", which means the scenery (that is constantly moving towards the player of the game who controls "Toby" the cat), would start to speed up, which would make it harder to react to the objects.

## 2

Please make Toby white, with black and grey colours. Please add some music as a background, can you add a timer counting up, so that you know how long you have been playing. Instead of the objects falling down, can we alter the aspect ratio so that they are coming towards you, more like running down a tunnel, than objects falling from the sky?

## 3

This is better, however, please can there only two "bad" things and two "good" things, the bad things can be a puddle of water and a hair dryer. The good items can be the Chicken leg and the Shrimp. Can the tunnel have a background, so that it looks like garden, with green grass near Toby and blue sky with clouds and sun. Also can it be a little slower, as when it speeds up, it is too fast.

## 4

Please create a new "CHANGELOG" file in the working folder, and a version number of the game, so that we can track improvements and changes over time. Please add the most recent changes as version 0.1.0.

## 5

On the "home screen", toby is the wrong colour, please update him.

## 6

The colour looks better, but the icon is not shown in the box correctly

## 7

The start button is not shown now!! - Please correct the home screen properly!

## 8

On the game over screen, Toby is the wrong colour, please update for consistency. Instead of the game continuing for ever, can we add levels that complete, and the next level looks a little different, such as different backgrounds, like a park with slides and swings, or even perhaps Toby goes into outer space, and there are stars and planets. Also the icon for the hair dryer looks like a cloud of gas, such as a fart, please update the Hair dryer to look like an actual hair dryer. Also do you think we could occasionally have a "Shield" that gives you temporary protection from the puddles and hair dryer, which is you collect the shield, the game shows a count down, and Toby is protected by a bubble, when the shield expires, the bubble pops. And the flowers on level 1, looks too basic, give them more detail. And lastly, can we improve the music please?

## 9

Change the music, make it less childish and annoying. Change the  hair dryer object that you need to avoid, to be a Fish Skeleton. And change the Shrimp to a "Nice" Fish, that is a similar shape to the dead fish. Make each different theme, only have two levels instead of three, garden level 1, park level 2 and outer space level 3. We could also add a "Snow" themed level after space. Please also update Toby's eyes, to be yellow / green colour, with black pupils. Overall can you make it more realistic, like a video game?
